AbstractEZ430

Features:

- Getting ACC  / PPT data in real time
- Getting data in SYNC mode and modifying watch parameters
- Auto Detecting of the SerialPort(Linux/OSX)
- a few example in c++ and python

Test Program:

- Openserial => First try into revert engeneering the watch protocole (work but deprecacted)
- Ap => First program that connect to the watch with the lib
- Pywatch => First Python application with the binding show ACC datas

- Watch => This program can start or stop the RF dongle and read datas on the watch in mode ACC or PPT
- SyncMode => This program can test the sync mode of the watch
- 3dDemo => Is a sword in 3d witch have been controlled by the watch but not work that well
- Abpos => This soft try to make a calibration of the watch

Faq:

Why can i activate the alarm from the computer ?
"Because the Ti protocole don't give us this possibility"

Why the application does not start with /dev/ttyAMC0 ?
"Because on your OS the RF dongle is called differently (for example on OSX 10.6 it's called tty.usbmodem001)"

Todo:

In priority order:
- Asynchrone (get the acc datas by callback in a dedicated thread)
- C Binding
- AutoDetecting Serial port Windows
- Add conversion acc data to mgrav (cf. test/watch)
- Add some filter to the ACC data like low-pass and high-pass filter and put it in watch class
- Handle the RFBSL => Need new RF module
