Technically we deal only with the RF USB Key
that do all the RF work itself.

Watch have 3 modes :
	- ACC/PPT -> motion events and/or buttons events.
	- SYNC    -> read/set date/time/altimeter/temperature
	- WBSL    -> update firmware on air.

All theses modes can't work together in the same time.

Notice that ACC and PPT use exactly the same protocol.
The difference is just on the watch menu because the
PPT mode take care about energy consumption by
not sending the motion events.
We can know the current mode when receiving data.

The WBSL mode work only with last RF firmware we don't have,
however we can implement the code without testing it.

The global protocol for all theses mode
is SimpliciTI (see simpliciti.txt).

Following a list of different
