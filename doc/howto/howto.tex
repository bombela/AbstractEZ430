\section{Introduction}

This HOWTO will present to you the best and simple way
to use the AbstractEZ430 library.

You will learn to initiate a communication to an access point,
and next how to communicate with the watch.

The two languages actually supported by the library
are C++ (natively supported) and Python (binding).

The API (Application Programming Interface) is OO (Oriented Object)
both supported by C++ and Python.

The API propose tree classes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{AccessPoint},
			Provide the necessary for controlling the RF (Radio Frequency) access point.
			Need a serial port to operate on it.
	\item \textbf{Service},
			The most basic way to communicate with the watch proposed
			by the API. This is not indented to be user friendly.
			AccessPoint class provide a specialized version of this service
			to be used by the Watch class.
	\item \textbf{Watch},
			an high-level class to communication with the watch via the RF access point.
			This class need a Service implementation to deal with the watch,
			like the Service gibed by the AccessPoint class.
			The Watch class is only a wrapper class on top of the Service class,
			for providing an easier interface to the library user.
\end{itemize}
